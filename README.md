## FAQ
**Why does my Anti-Virus detect NekoBox as malware?** <br/>
NekoBox's built-in update functionallity downloads the new release, removes the old files and replaces them with the new ones, which is quite simliar to what malwares do, remove your files and replace them with an encrypted version of your files.
Also the `System DNS` feature will change your system's DNS settings, which is also considered a dangerous action by some Anti-Virus applications.

**Is setting the `SUID` bit really needed on Linux?** <br/>
No, it is not needed, but if `SUID` does not configured properly, the NekoBox shall ask for administrator password to order to restart nekobox_core with administrator privilegies, if NekoBox is not already running as root. NekoBox will ask for password for once, and will not configure `SUID`.
